    <h2>It's unexpected, isn't it?</h2>
    <p>Those red flower trees— they’re strangely addictive.</p>
    <p>I'll get straight to the point: I'll have to shut down takina.jp.net for now.</p>
    <p>Don’t blame me; I tried everything I could, but it's no use. In the end, the Brazilian government still upholds a law from 1964 regarding mandatory service.</p>
    <p>I apologize to those who were eager to try out Ashen or use MuraJS in their projects. Unfortunately, both will be offline for the next year or so.</p>
    <p>I can’t escape a Leviathan that seeks to destroy, manipulate, and control people who never had a choice about where to live, signing a social contract they never wanted. And yet, people still claim we're free. No, you're not free while *they* remain in alive.</p>
